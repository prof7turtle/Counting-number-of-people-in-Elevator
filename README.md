# Counting Number of People in Elevator

Elevator Occupancy Counter Using ESP-32

•This project addresses a common inconvenience faced by users waiting for elevators, where the elevator often arrives already full, leading to wasted time. 

•To solve this problem, I developed a system using the ESP-32 microcontroller to count the number of people inside the elevator. 
 The system displays the real-time occupancy count on a screen located in the waiting lobby. 
 
•This allows users to make informed decisions about whether to wait or consider alternative options, ultimately improving efficiency and reducing frustration.
